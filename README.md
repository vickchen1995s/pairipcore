# pairipcore

The purpose of this repository is to warn everyone about the repository
https://github.com/Solaree/pairipcore, its owner "Solaree":https://github.com/Solaree,
and his Discord server: https://veux.su/discord.

He claims that he can manually or automatically remove "pairipcore".
Do **not** trust this claim. I was personally scammed and suffered financial loss.

After receiving payment, he immediately deleted all chat history and blocked me.
Any issue I created on his repository was also deleted shortly after.

Therefore, I created this repository to warn others.

Based on my research, Pairip generates a unique virtual machine and bytecode for
each application. Anyone claiming they can automatically remove pairipcore is
not telling the truth. Even manual analysis is extremely time-consuming, and the
effort and expertise required are expensive.

Please be cautious.
